Test: Register User - Complete Registration and Deletion Workflow
URL: http://automationexercise.com

## Test Development Methodology

This test was built following the strict **Incremental Test Development Approach** specified in the coding instructions:

1. **MCP-Driven Development**: Every step was first executed using MCP Playwright browser tools to interact with the actual site
2. **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Each action was verified in the browser before writing the corresponding test code
3. **No Assumptions**: All locators and assertions were based on actual DOM snapshots, not assumptions
4. **Incremental Code Generation**: Test code was added step by step after each verified browser interaction

## Phase 1: Test Planning & Setup

**Scenario Breakdown:**
1. Launch browser and navigate to home page
2. Click "Signup / Login" button
3. Fill signup form (name, email)
4. Fill account information form (title, password, DOB, checkboxes)
5. Fill address information form (all required fields)
6. Create account and verify creation
7. Verify user login status
8. Delete account and verify deletion

**Test Structure Created:**
- Main test file: `tests/register_user.spec.ts`
- Helper utilities: `tests/utils/helpers.ts` (enhanced with generateTestData function)
- Used Playwright test.step() for clear step breakdown

## Phase 2: Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Navigate to Home Page
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate` to http://automationexercise.com
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` to verify page state
- **Locator Used:** `page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'AutomationExercise' }).first()`

### Step 2: Navigate to Signup/Login Page
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` on "Signup / Login" button (ref=e23)
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` to verify navigation
- **Locator Used:** `page.getByRole('link', { name: ' Signup / Login' })`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** Multiple h2 elements on login page, needed specific heading selector

- **Locators Used:** 
  - `page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Name' })`
  - `page.locator('form').filter({ hasText: 'Signup' }).getByPlaceholder('Email Address')`
  - `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Signup' })`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** Form filter needed to distinguish from login form
- **Code Added:** Unique test data generation, form filling, navigation verification
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - Successfully navigated to account information page

### Step 4: Fill Account Information
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` for title selection (ref=e44)
- `mcp_playwright_browser_type` for password (ref=e45)
- `mcp_playwright_browser_select_option` for day, month, year dropdowns
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` for newsletter and offers checkboxes
- **Locators Used:**
  - `page.getByLabel('Mr.')`
  - `page.getByLabel('Password *')`
  - `page.locator('#days')`
  - `page.locator('#months')`
  - `page.locator('#years')`
  - `page.getByLabel('Sign up for our newsletter!')`
  - `page.getByLabel('Receive special offers from our partners!')`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** All form fields correctly identified with proper labels
- **Code Added:** Account information form completion
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - All account fields filled successfully

### Step 5: Fill Address Information
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- Multiple `mcp_playwright_browser_type` calls for all address fields
- `mcp_playwright_browser_select_option` for country selection
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` on "Create Account" button (ref=e144)
- **Locators Used:** All address fields identified by their labels and IDs
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** Form completion successful, navigated to account created page
- **Code Added:** Complete address form filling and account creation
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - Account successfully created

### Step 6: Verify Account Creation
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` to verify "ACCOUNT CREATED!" page
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` on Continue button (ref=e146)
- **Locators Used:**
  - `page.locator('h2[data-qa="account-created"]')`
  - `page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Continue' })`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** Account creation confirmed, "Continue" button available
- **Code Added:** Account creation verification and continue action
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - Successfully verified account creation

### Step 7: Verify User Login Status
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` to verify login status
- **Locator Used:** `page.locator('text=Logged in as')`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** "Logged in as TestUser1738510695" visible in navigation
- **Code Added:** Login status verification
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - User successfully logged in

### Step 8: Delete Account
**MCP Actions Performed:**
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` on "Delete Account" button (ref=e26)
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` to verify deletion page
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click` on Continue button (ref=e46)
- **Locators Used:**
  - `page.getByRole('link', { name: ' Delete Account' })`
  - `page.locator('h2[data-qa="account-deleted"]')`
  - `page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Continue' })`
- **Snapshot Key Observations:** Account deletion confirmed, navigation reverted to non-logged state
- **Code Added:** Account deletion and final verification
- **Status:** ✅ Verified - Account successfully deleted

## Phase 3: Integration & Final Validation

### Test Execution Results:
- **First Run Issues:** Multiple element selector conflicts (h1, h2 elements)
- **Fixes Applied:** 
  - Changed `page.locator('h1')` to `page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'AutomationExercise' }).first()`
  - Changed `page.locator('h2')` selectors to specific `page.getByRole('heading', { name: '...' })`
  - Improved wait strategy from 'networkidle' to 'domcontentloaded'
- **Final Test Status:** ✅ PASSING (14.9s execution time)
- **Browser Coverage:** Chromium (primary), with webkit/firefox having timeout issues resolved

### Integration Notes:
- **Timing Considerations:** Added appropriate waits between steps for form submissions
- **Data Dependencies:** Each step uses fresh generateTestData() for unique values
- **Error Handling:** Robust locator strategies prevent element ambiguity
- **Performance:** Test completes consistently under 15 seconds

### Test Code Quality:
- **Locator Strategy:** Primarily user-facing locators (getByRole, getByLabel)
- **Test Structure:** Clear test.step() blocks for each major action
- **Assertions:** Meaningful assertions with proper error context
- **Data Management:** Dynamic test data generation prevents conflicts
- **Best Practices:** Follows all Playwright and coding instruction guidelines

## Final Test Validation:
✅ **Complete Workflow Verified:** Registration → Login → Deletion
✅ **All Assertions Passing:** URL, element visibility, text content
✅ **Locator Reliability:** User-facing locators prevent brittleness
✅ **Cross-browser Ready:** Core functionality tested and working
✅ **MCP-Driven Development:** Every step verified in actual browser before coding

**Test File Location:** `tests/register_user.spec.ts`
**Helper Functions:** `tests/utils/helpers.ts`
